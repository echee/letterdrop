## Letterdrop

This pulls down all the email templates that you may have in mandrill.

I wrote it so I could check for specific text on my local machine faster than if I had to use the Mandrill site.

At the time I needed to remove specific bits of copy from the emails, but we didn't know what emails we had or where the copy was.
